    <textOnly>Hi  {!Contact.FirstName} -

I hope your day is going well! I am following-up to my note sent a few days ago. Have you given any thought to scheduling a training on your CisionPoint account? If you (or your team) are interested, could you please reply to this note with the following:

Day/time(s) that you have in mind for the training (the session will last 1 hour)*
Your current timezone
Areas of CisionPoint that you would like to cover (ex: List Building, Monitoring, etc)
How many people will be attending the session

*Please note that our team works on a first come, first served basis. If you are interested in locking-in the above time, please let us know as soon as possible.

I look forward to connecting with you soon!

Best,
