    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName} -

I hope this finds you well! My name is {!Case.OwnerFirstName} and I am a Training Consultant here at Cision. I wanted to reach out on behalf of our training team about your Cision account. Would you or any of your colleagues be interested in setting up a training consultation on your account?

Our trainings are completely complementary and would be held in a virtual meeting environment. If you are interested in scheduling the training, could you please reply to this note with the following:

Day/time(s) that you have in mind for the training (the session will last 1 hour)*
Your current timezone
Areas of CisionPoint that you would like to cover (ex: List Building, Monitoring, etc)
How many people will be attending the session

*Please note that our team works on a first come, first served basis. If you are interested in locking-in the above time, please let us know as soon as possible.

In addition, you can always access our full suite of complimentary training resources (including weekly webinars, small group sessions, onboarding materials, pdf reference guides and self-paced videos) here http://www.cision.com/us/support/client-training/

I look forward to connecting with you soon!

Best,
{!Case.OwnerFullName}</textOnly>
